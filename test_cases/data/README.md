# Data Sources

The directory _test_cases/data/_ contains imaging from external sources:

- File *brain_atlas_image_t1_3d.mha* corresponds to T1-weighted MR from the **SRI24** atlas of normal adult brain anatomy (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/sri24/).
- File *brain_atlas_image_3d.mha* is a labelmap of brain structures (WM, GM, Ventricles, surrounding CSF) derived from the **SRI24** labelmap.

- Files in directory _test_cases/data/TCGA/_ contain T1-Gd MR images and segmentation labels derived from the TCGA-GBM dataset (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/TCGA-GBM):
